Hi, I'm Yuchen Luo, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Arkansas, and expect to complete my Ph.D. degree requirements by May 2024. I am on the Academic Job Market in 2023. My primary research interest includes empirical investment and corporate finance.

Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I earned my bachelor's degree in Finance from Beijing Technology & Business University and my master's degree in Finance from Lingnan University, Hong Kong. I also gained several years of industry experience in the banking and investment sectors.
